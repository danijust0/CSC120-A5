- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

I initially thought that Association, in practice, made programming more confusing, however, I quickly learned that understanding the relationships between objects actually helped me make my code more organized. I now understand that Association helps you program more efficiently and intentionally.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Everything worked pretty smoothly until I attempted to complete Train.java. I found it difficult to wrap my head around the way that the train, when created, came with cars and an engine, but did not come with passengers. There were a lot of moving parts to tie together, so it took me a while to finally come to a solution, but I think that starting the assignment a bit earlier, and giving oneself time to understand the associations between objects would be good steps to take for someone else taking this cours in the future.
